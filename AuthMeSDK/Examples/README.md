- Windows (for Windows Forms and WPF examples)

### Configuration

Before running any example, you need to configure your AuthMe credentials:

1. Open the example project you want to run
2. Locate the configuration section in the main file:
   - `ConsoleApp/Program.cs`
   - `WindowsFormsApp/MainForm.cs`
   - `WpfApp/MainWindow.xaml.cs`

3. Replace the placeholder values:
```csharp
var config = new AuthMeConfig
{
    AppId = "‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢",                  // Replace with your App ID from dashboard
    AppSecret = "‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢",            // Replace with your App Secret from dashboard
    AppName = "‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢",                 // Replace with your application name
    CacheDurationSeconds = 3, // Short cache for security
    HwidMethod = HwidMethod.Comprehensive, // Hardware ID method
    DiscordSupport = "discord.gg/server" // Your support server
};
```

### Running the Examples

#### Console Application
```bash
cd Examples/ConsoleApp
dotnet run
```

#### Windows Forms Application
```bash
cd Examples/WindowsFormsApp
dotnet run
```

#### WPF Application
```bash

```

## üîß Integration Guide

### Basic Integration Steps

1. **Add NuGet Package**
```xml
<PackageReference Include="KeyAuth.NET" Version="1.0.0" />
```

2. **Configure KeyAuth**
```csharp
var config = new AuthMeConfig
{
    AppId = "‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢",                  // Replace with your App ID from dashboard
    AppSecret = "‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢",            // Replace with your App Secret from dashboard
    AppName = "‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢",                 // Replace with your application name
    CacheDurationSeconds = 3, // Short cache for security
    HwidMethod = HwidMethod.Comprehensive, // Hardware ID method
    DiscordSupport = "discord.gg/server" // Your support server
};
```

3. **Initialize Client**
```csharp
using var authMe = new AuthMeClient(config);
```

4. **Validate License**
```csharp
var result = await authMe.ValidateKeyAsync(licenseKey);
if (result.IsValid)
{
    // Grant access to protected features
    var keyData = result.KeyData;
    Console.WriteLine($"Welcome! Tier: {keyData.Tier}, Expires: {keyData.ExpiresAt}");
}
```

### Common Patterns

#### Simple Validation
```csharp
var result = await authMe.ValidateKeyAsync("LICENSE-KEY");
if (result.IsValid)
{
    // Success - enable protected features
    var keyData = result.KeyData;
    MessageBox.Show($"Welcome! Your {keyData.Tier} license is valid until {keyData.ExpiresAt}");
}
else
{
    // Failure - show error message
    MessageBox.Show($"License validation failed: {result.Message}");
    
    // Handle security violations
    if (result.IsSecurityViolation)
    {
        MessageBox.Show("Security violation detected. Contact support.", "Security Alert", MessageBoxButtons.OK, MessageBoxIcon.Warning);
    }
}
```

#### Authentication with UI Feedback
```csharp
var authResult = await authMe.AuthenticateAsync("LICENSE-KEY", showValidationDetails: true);
if (authResult.IsSuccess)
{
    // Show license information
    var keyData = authResult.KeyData;
    Console.WriteLine($"üéâ Welcome! Your {keyData.Tier} license expires: {keyData.ExpiresAt}");
    Console.WriteLine($"üìä Usage: {keyData.UsageCount}/{(keyData.IsUnlimited ? "‚àû" : keyData.MaxUses.ToString())}");
    
    // Access analytics if enabled
    if (config.EnableAnalytics)
    {
        var analytics = await authMe.GetAnalyticsAsync();
        Console.WriteLine($"üìà Total validations today: {analytics.TodayValidations}");
    }
}
```

#### Security Violation Handling
```csharp
if (!result.IsValid && result.IsSecurityViolation)
{
    MessageBox.Show(
        "üö® SECURITY ALERT: Your license has been revoked due to suspicious activity.\n" +
        "This may be due to:\n" +
        "‚Ä¢ Using the license on multiple devices\n" +
        "‚Ä¢ Hardware ID mismatch\n" +
        "‚Ä¢ Unusual usage patterns\n\n" +
        $"Contact support at {config.DiscordSupport} if this is an error.",
        "Security Violation Detected",
        MessageBoxButtons.OK,
        MessageBoxIcon.Warning
    );
    
    // Log security violation for monitoring
    await authMe.LogSecurityViolationAsync(result.ErrorCode, result.Message);
}
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices

### 1. Configuration Security
- Store AuthMe credentials securely (environment variables, config files, Azure Key Vault)
- Use different App IDs and secrets for development and production environments
- Never hardcode credentials in source code - use configuration management
- Implement credential rotation policies for enhanced security
- Use encrypted configuration files for sensitive data

### 2. Error Handling
- Always handle validation failures gracefully with user-friendly messages
- Provide clear, actionable error messages to users
- Log security violations for monitoring and analytics
- Implement retry logic for transient network failures
- Use structured logging for better debugging and monitoring
- Handle rate limiting scenarios appropriately

### 3. UI/UX Considerations
- Show validation progress to users with progress bars or spinners
- Provide clear success/failure feedback with appropriate icons and colors
- Include support contact information and helpful troubleshooting steps
- Implement toast notifications for non-blocking feedback
- Use consistent UI patterns across different validation states
- Provide contextual help and tooltips for complex features

### 4. Performance
- Use caching appropriately (default 3 seconds is recommended for security)
- Handle network timeouts gracefully with exponential backoff
- Test connection before validation if needed, especially in offline scenarios
- Implement connection pooling for high-throughput applications
- Use async/await patterns consistently for better performance
- Monitor and optimize API call patterns to reduce unnecessary requests
- Implement circuit breaker patterns for resilient network communication

## üì± Platform-Specific Notes

### Console Applications
- Perfect for CLI tools and background services
- Minimal UI overhead
- Easy to integrate into existing console apps

### Windows Forms
- Great for traditional Windows desktop applications
- Rich control library
- Easy event-driven programming model

### WPF
- Modern Windows applications with rich UI
- Data binding and MVVM support
- Scalable vector graphics and animations

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Invalid Configuration Error**
   - Check AuthMe App ID and App Secret are correct (format: app_xxxxxxxx and sk_xxxxxxxx)
   - Ensure API URL includes protocol (http:// or https://)
   - Verify App Name matches your dashboard configuration

2. **Connection Timeout**
   - Check internet connection and firewall settings
   - Verify AuthMe service is accessible and running
   - Increase timeout in configuration if needed
   - Check for proxy or VPN interference

3. **Hardware ID Issues**
   - Try different HWID methods if detection fails (Basic, Comprehensive, Custom)
   - Check Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) service is running
   - Verify administrator privileges if using comprehensive HWID method
   - Test hardware ID generation with GetHardwareInfo() method

4. **License Validation Failures**
   - Verify license key format and validity (AUTHME-TIER-xxxxxxxxxx)
   - Check if key has been revoked, expired, or reached usage limit
   - Ensure hardware ID binding is correct
   - Verify application is active in AuthMe dashboard
   - Check rate limiting status

5. **Security Violations**
   - Review hardware ID binding settings
   - Check for multiple device usage
   - Verify license key hasn't been shared
   - Contact support for false positive violations

6. **Analytics and Caching Issues**
   - Clear cache using ClearCache() method if needed
   - Check analytics permissions in dashboard
   - Verify network connectivity for real-time features
